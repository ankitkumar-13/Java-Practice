Q1) WAP that accepts 5 email addresses from user and store them in a HashSet.
Ensure no duplicate emails are added, and display a message if a duplicate is attempted. 
Use an iterator to traverse the set and print alternate email address. 
Using for loop, print count of all email addresses from the HashSet containing less than 5 characters.

Q2) Create an abstract class Document with an abstract method open() and 
a concrete method getType(). Define an interface Sharable with method share(), and 
extend it with CloudSharable adding method uploadToCloud(). 
Create two classes PDFDocument and WordDocument that use Document and CloudSharable. 
Demonstrate runtime polymorphism to invoke implemented methods on both classes.

Q3) WAP to accept user's name and age. Throw an exception and terminate 
the program with appropriate message if user’s age is less than 18 or more than 60. 
Otherwise insert name and age into the database, and print how many rows are
affected – assuming that a table User exists in database with columns Name and Age.
